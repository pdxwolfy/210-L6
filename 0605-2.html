/*
 * As with the previous snippet, both the declarations for the variable counter
 * and the function counter are hoisted to the top of the code. The definition
 * of the function counter is also hoisted, but the initialization of the
 * variable is not. So, the function definition is in effect when we try to
 * computer `counter * rate`. Since you can't multiply a function by a number, the result is NaN. Therefore, this code prints:
 *
 * The total value is NaN
